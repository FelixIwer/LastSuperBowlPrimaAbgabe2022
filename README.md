|  1 | Units and Positions | An X-Y coordinate system was used. Camera was fixed at point that it seems as it would be 2D but it is 3 dimensional. Everything in the Canvas was sized for the Viewer to see it at a good height. |
|  2 | Hierarchy         | There is a Main Node called Game. All Things seen in the Scene are childs of the Game Node except the Football, which is loaded in as a child later. |

|  8 | Event-System      | Event System is used for collision between the Hero and for example the Football. |
|  9 | External Data     | There is one Json File with information about the Camera, because of hardcoded Numbers. |
|  A | Light             | There is one source of light in the Scene appended to the Game Node. |
